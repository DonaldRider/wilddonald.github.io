        <p>An owl is amongst one of the most timeless, tasteful tattoo choices. Though it has been appropriated by thousands of tattoo lovers, its intricacies welcome a diverse array of interpretations, supplying inspiration to tattoo artists with styles ranging from hyper realistic to abstract. </p>

<p>If you’re considering getting under the needle to have an owl design inked on for life, it’s probably best that you first consider what an owl traditionally symbolizes. </p>

<p>Arguably the most pervasive quality attached to owls I wisdom. According to ancient Greek mythology, the owl was the symbol for Athena, the goddess of wisdom and warfare, before the Greeks gave the pantheon human forms. </p>

<p>But even after the pantheon was humanized, the owl remained Athena’s attribute or mascot. The owl would sit on Athena’s blind side, so that she could always see the whole truth.At times, she herself would take the form of her owl. </p>

<p>As such, the owl was and remains a symbol of higher wisdom and strategy. An owl tattoo can represent the pursuit of wisdom and the perseverance to work through hardships to achieve that wisdom. </p>

<p>In Hindu culture, the owl is associated with the goddess Lakshmi. She represents prosperity and wealth and is said to be the mistress of spiritual wisdom. In many images depicting her, she is depicted with an owl. The owl is meant to teach the art of opening our eyes to the light of the wisdom residing within us. </p>

<p>The Native Americans had quite a different interpretation of owls, with disparities and differences from tribe to tribe. In some Native America legends and myths, such as those from the Ojibwa Tribe, an owl was mostly a symbol of death, or signified troubles are to come. </p>

<p>As creatures of the night, Pueblo Indians are known to have strongly associated owls with mysticism and the supernatural, and believed them to be messengers from the afterlife sent to deliver warnings or to represent the soul of a dead person. The Lakota tribe paint dark circles around their eyes because they believed it would bring them an owl’s acute night vision.</p>

<p>Modern day representations of owls often stir some of these remaining historical sentiments. There is something distinctly mystical and enchanting about owls, and their demeanor and magnetism are awe-inspiring. Because the have so many interpretations and meanings - symbol for wisdom, learning, the supernatural, spirituality, the afterlife – the message is often a product of the intent.</p>

<p>When choosing your <a href="http://thewildtattoo.com/owl-tattoos/">owl tattoo</a> design, keep in mind that there are more than 100 species of owls. Owns can have orange, yellow, green, black, or brown eyes. The hues of their feathers, their size, and the shape of their heads all depend upon which species you’re looking at. </p>

<p>The diversity within the appearance of owls allows you to select an owl that embodies the meaning you would like to create in your tattoo. See examples below of how certain owl tattoos have the power to generate a specific sentiment, and to consider which meaning you’d like to communicate when proudly parading your owl ink in public:</p>
